Assignment2 - Cindy Lin


2)
Metric to evaluate states:
	greater of heuristic 2
	if equal, greater of heuristic 1
	if equal, greater of -(heuristic 3) 
	**heuristics are described below in #5

5)
Heuristic 1.
Agent piece is ajacent to an adversary piece it loses to. -100
Agent piece is ajacent to an adversary piece it wins to. +100
Agent piece is ajacent to the same piece. -50
Agent piece is ajacent to a pit. -25 

Heuristic 2. 
Difference between number of agent pieces and number of adversary pieces

Heuristic 3.
Sum of distance of agent pieces to adversary pieces that agent wins against. 
A lower distance is a better state.

Heuristic 4.
+1 for every Agent piece1 is ajacent to agent piece2. 
If agent piece1 gets killed by an adversary piece. 
Agent piece2 can kill that adversary piece.


Heuristic 5.
Sum of surrounding empty area around each piece.
Higher sum is better because there more spaces to move to in order to escape adversary pieces.
And because it lowers the amount of safe spaces than adversary pieces can move to.
